Pros -
1. More intuitive for DevOps team that is platform/method centric
2. DevOps team can download the deployments manifests without an understanding of the architecture 

Cons -
1. Requires a separation between Aqua Cloud and Aqua Enterprise. In fact, Aqua Cloud is a subset of Aqua Enterprise deployment tools limited to enforcers and the scanner
2. Need to maintain duplicate folders and manifest files between Aqua Cloud and Aqua Enterprise
