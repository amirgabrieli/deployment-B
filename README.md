# Platform centric structure  

This deployments repo structure is platform centirc. The path guideline for the deployment tool/manifest is  **path::[Platform]/[Method]/[Component]**

Pros -
1. More intuative for DecOps team that are platform/method centric
2. DevOps team can download the deployments manifests without understanding of the architecture 

Cons -
1. Requires a seperation between Aqua Cloud and Aqua Enterprise 
2. Need to duplicte folders and manifest files between Aqua Cloud and Aqua Entperprise
